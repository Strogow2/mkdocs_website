No stock has all factors observed at any point in time, a problem that is highlighted by the multidimensional nature of asset pricing data. Due to the complex nature of missing patterns and their importance for inference on anomalies, I perform a comparative analysis of imputation methods for missing data in the cross-section of char acteristics. Through an EM algorithm, I perform imputations for 120 signals. </p> <p>Imputations have a marginal effect when considering 120 signals alone, re sulting in a .5% drop in the average cumulative return of anomalies with a .1 drop in Sharpe ratio. However, performance disparity becomes economically significant when considering a larger set of signals. Average signal cumu lative return drops by more than 40% when considering 204 signals in the sample.</p>"},{"location":"Missing_data_Everywhere/#main-findings","title":"Main findings","text":"<p>Paterns of missing observations in asset pricing data is persistent and complex, with a considerable proportion of observations missing from most datasets in the industry.</p> <p>Notably, in most novel datasets in the current literature, missing observations consist of at least a third of total observations.</p> Data Subsets Dataset 1 Dataset 2 Dataset 3 Missing % 56.2% 36.5% 38.2% Coverage 204 120 80 Date Range 1925-2023 1986-2022 1978-2021 <p>The data above consists of three datasets that contain fator data. A factor here refers to a characteristic or signal that is assumed to produce abnormal returns. All three datasets were built in somewhat a similar way. They scraped signals that were published in the literature, replicated the signals and constructed a large panel dataset with signals across time. As you observed in the table above, many of those signals have missing data.</p> <p>In the current literature, missing observations are either dropped or replased with the mean of observations. This would be okay if data was missing at random.</p> <p>However, when taking a close look at how data is missing, we can see that current methods are not achieving the desiered effect.
